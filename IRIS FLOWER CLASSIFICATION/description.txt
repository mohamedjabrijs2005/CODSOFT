Iris Flower Classification

This project uses a Random Forest classifier to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. 
The dataset contains measurements for three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. 
The code demonstrates data loading, exploration, visualization, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
