# Sales Prediction using Python

This project demonstrates how to use Python and machine learning to predict product sales based on advertising spend across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels. The workflow includes data loading, exploration, visualization, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Dataset
- **File:** `advertising.csv`
- **Columns:**
  - `TV`: Advertising budget spent on TV (in thousands of dollars)
  - `Radio`: Advertising budget spent on Radio (in thousands of dollars)
  - `Newspaper`: Advertising budget spent on Newspaper (in thousands of dollars)
  - `Sales`: Sales of the product (in thousands of units)

## Steps
1. Import required libraries
2. Load and explore the dataset
3. Visualize relationships between features and sales
4. Split data into training and test sets
5. Train a Linear Regression model
6. Evaluate the model
7. Visualize predictions
8. Interpret model coefficients

## Usage
- Ensure `advertising.csv` is in the project directory.
- Run `Sales Prediction using Python.py` to execute the workflow.
- View results in the terminal and generated plots.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
