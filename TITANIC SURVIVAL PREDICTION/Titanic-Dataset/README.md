# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more. The model is built using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn, and demonstrates basic data cleaning, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation.

## How it works
- Loads the Titanic dataset from a CSV file
- Cleans missing values and encodes categorical features
- Splits the data into training and test sets
- Trains a Random Forest classifier
- Evaluates the model's accuracy and prints a classification report

## Files
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: The dataset file
- `titanic-dataset.py`: The main Python script for training and evaluating the model
- `titanic-dataset.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook version of the workflow

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas scikit-learn`
2. Run the script: `python titanic-dataset.py`
3. Or open the notebook: `titanic-dataset.ipynb`

## Output
The script prints the model's accuracy and a classification report to the console.
