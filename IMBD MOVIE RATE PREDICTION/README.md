# Movie Rate Prediction

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to predict movie ratings using a machine learning pipeline with synthetic data. The model uses a Random Forest Regressor and includes preprocessing for both categorical and numerical features.

## Features
- Synthetic data generation for movies (genre, director, actor, budget, duration, rating)
- Preprocessing pipeline using OneHotEncoder and StandardScaler
- Random Forest regression model
- Model evaluation (Mean Squared Error, R2 Score)
- Predicting the rating for a new movie

## Getting Started
