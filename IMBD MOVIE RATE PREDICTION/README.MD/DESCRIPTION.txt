# Movie Rate Prediction - Project Description

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline for predicting movie ratings based on synthetic data. The workflow includes data generation, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction for a new movie. The model uses a Random Forest Regressor and handles both categorical and numerical features using a pipeline with one-hot encoding and standard scaling.

## Features
- Synthetic dataset generation with genres, directors, actors, budget, and duration
- Preprocessing pipeline for categorical and numerical features
- Random Forest regression model
- Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error and R2 Score
- Example prediction for a new movie

## Usage
1. Run the Python script to generate the dataset, train the model, and see evaluation metrics.
2. The script will also predict the rating for a sample new movie.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
